# BizDemo

## Description
The project entails the development of a mobile application that provides a "Company" Module with a form that captures relevant information about the company, such as the name, address, NIT, and telephone number. The application also includes a "Products" view with a list to display information about the products, such as the name, details, price in different currencies, and the company associated with it. The information entered into both forms will be stored in a database, and the application will provide the necessary views to insert, edit, and delete this data. This application aims to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to manage their company and products efficiently.

## Features

- Authentication Module
  -   Sign In with NIT
  -   Sign Up for Companies
- Products
  -  Products List
  -  New Product

## Architecture

Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) for Authentication
VIPER for Products

## Known Issues

For Demonstration purposes I made use of VIPER and MVVM with the intention of showing my understanding of their use, but in a real world scenario only one Architectural Pattern for project requirements should be chosen.

## Relevant Information

The development tools used: XCode
Any third-party libraries or frameworks: Firebase
Any design patterns or software engineering principles used: VIPER, MVVM , DELEGATION
